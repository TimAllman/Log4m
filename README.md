# Log4m

This is an Objective-C logging facility based upon log4cplus. It is essentially a front end for log4cplus (http://sourceforge.net/p/log4cplus/wiki/Home/) which contains Obj-C macros to allow logging in Obj-C files. The logging system must first be set up in a C++ source file (see https://github.com/TimAllman/ConvertToDicom/blob/master/ConvertToDicom/LoggerUtils.mm for an example).

Better documentation will follow when time permits.
